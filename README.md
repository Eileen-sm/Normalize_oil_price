# Normalize_oil_price
 for normalizing r and price according to the length of bins which was 25, I've deleted 2 of 1827 variables so I could reshape the r and price into a matrix which is (25,73).
After that I added the mean and std functions to calculate the amount of average and standard deviation then I wrote the function of normalizing data.
